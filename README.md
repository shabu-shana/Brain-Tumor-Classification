# Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning
SPIS Project 2025
Programmer(s): Shana Ibatuan

Brain tumors vary in size and location, making analysis challenging. MRI interpretation often requires a skilled neurosurgeon, which can be limited in developing countries. An automated cloud-based system can help generate reports quickly and accurately.

This project implements a deep learning model capable of classifying brain tumors from MRI images. The repository also includes an interactive web application where users can upload their own brain scan images to get a predicted tumor type, confidence score, and relevant information about the tumor.

The model was trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle:  
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

Images were preprocessed by resizing to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values.

Features 
- Classifies brain tumors into multiple categories
- Outputs predicted tumor type with confidence score
- Provides educational information about the predicted tumor
- Web interface for users to upload and analyze images interactively

Model
- Architecture: CNN
- Input shape: 224x224 RGB images
- Output: Tumor class probabilities
- Accuracy: 93% on test dataset
